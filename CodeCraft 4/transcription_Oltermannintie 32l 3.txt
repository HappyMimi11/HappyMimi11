humans achieve without augmentation now we as this now we as society face the challenge how to safely deploy this this power we have especially as artificial intelligence surpasses human ability in a wider increasingly wide mobile prizes to honor the greatest contributions in science are awarded to the pioneers of artificial intelligence and this is this is only this is only the beginning transform live at the hinge of history we who live in the era of change in the era where these systems are being developed and deployed and where they rise to superhuman capabilities we are the ones responsible for ensuring that the systems shape the future in these systems we create shape the future in a desirable way we set that we are potentially setting the trajectory for humanity for you know thousands or millions or even more years to come we are faced with a variety of technical challenges tremendous power safe way in a way that allows us to achieve its potential but also mitigate the risk of unprecedented catastrophe ensuring that technological solutions are in place ensuring that technological solutions for the safe employment of these tools are in place to be the most impactful thing anyone has ever done i think that's that's the the angle i will take but honestly that's the main reason why i am so fascinated with ai it's because it's because of its potential so yeah i might as well be honest about that you know originally interested in it because yeah cool philosophical considerations and theoretic considerations but interested in the the technology to begin with the reason i'm fascinated by it now are as such in fact yeah originally back when i wanted to become a physicist i became interested in ai actually because of its application to physics because this tool might reveal the most fundamental yet it might help us or let us answer the most fundamental questions about our universe but now you know over time i came to understand that really okay these are this is this is deciding the thing of humanity potentially so that is now the main reason why i'm interested i think if i just talk about entrepreneurship as i outlined earlier and then give a brief and concise statement about my interest in ai safety go through the job for this question so is there anything else that is still left report myself so you don't need to listen to this if you can if you're saying something i come to you do i want to keep listening i want to keep listening yeah i do and one of the questions is what do you get what do you hope to get out of the internship and the program that one is that one is very straightforward i want i want i want to build a company that changes the world and hence i want to get the skills uh to do this and i can talk about here too i can talk about you know how i quite believe that ai is pivotal and i want to here i can i can take a different different angle here i can talk about how i think that ai has the potential to know significantly radically enhance productivity of individuals and organizations working on the world's most stressing problems and i want to contribute to solving the problem solving the problem having those people and organizations implement ai solutions and do so quickly um to help them you know on the ball as it were and upskill for the coming and humans could very well be to give instructions to ai's so i'll just talk about the problem i want to solve and then say that oh yeah by the way i want to solve this problem with my co-founder nancy lee who has already been admitted to the program no better environment accelerating you'll development as an entrepreneur and this is why i want to attend i want to learn from the best i too can yeah so that i can be years from now now posting another question give me another one there are almost um no questions left now it's only yes one sentence only for the most impactful company in the past and in the future i just wrote i just wrote open ai and anthropic wrote what open ai yeah open ai in the past and tropic in the future okay i probably spent five minutes thinking about it that's cool what's the reason in only one sentence thing is that they're evaluating thousands of applications and they have the people are evaluating them are uh successful people whose time is incredibly valuable and they have better things to do than reading uh long i guess uh they were probably happy about my two word answers yes i think so let's see what do you think well i should approach giving these short answers uh transcribe copy paste and copy paste your answers no i meant you transcribe the recording and then you can give it to uh ai to refine it and then copy paste yes yes uh yes of course i'm just wondering like i still i'm still missing answers uh two of them you can copy paste my answers open ai and tropic i could late think that okay wait it was okay i wasn't it gdt open ai yeah okay yes is it yeah impactful company maybe open ai because they're building at this point okay because if if they stop working deep might will do the same thing a few months later all right the most what is going to be the most impactful the most impactful company will be company that will be a company that creates full brain emulation and beat all diseases and beat all diseases forever but i don't know this will happen in the next 10 years um so it would it would be great if it did maybe it made significant advances i do expect next 10 years the company we have here is on track for aging me that's on track for curing aging for you yes you can keep talking i'll be back in two minutes or so all right i can share my application process for so you you you you you you you
