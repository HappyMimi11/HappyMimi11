So once I got the more important features of my app built, I will get some point. I mean, the main thing is helping the user develop the skill of using AI to enhance their performance. And a crucial aspect of that will be knowing which tasks to delegate and which tasks to do themselves. In fact, most of the skill comes down to knowing which tasks to delegate and how to delegate them. And these will increasingly become increasingly important, especially the how to delegate them, as the what to delegate eventually becomes pretty much everything. Then again, if computing resources are limited, maybe you can't make your AIs do everything because you only have that much compute. You only have that much access to the highly capable models. Who knows? Regardless, this should naturally include letting the user manage their tasks using the AI management matrix. So I will want them to be able to, obviously I will want to include suggestions for what things belong in which category. I want to include that in my post update too. For example, things that AI is good at, summaries, brainstorming. Well, you'll want to brainstorm yourself, but summaries, suggesting improvements, which again is something that you may want to do yourself, depending on how good the AI is. Add that relative to you and your team, relative to your team, where if your team is just you, then that's the special case. That's the N equals one team, but that's perfectly fine. But yeah, as I was saying, I will want the user to be able to use the AI management matrix in my app. And if the user is using the AI management matrix in my app to manage their tasks, that means I will want to, this will be, this will be, I said that twice, I noticed that, and I will practice speaking with coherent, eloquent articulation. This will be optional to use, the core functionality is still the prompt for metastrategic brainstorming, specifically trying to think of ways to outsource it to AI. Before the task starts, before the user is sent to metastrategic brainstorming, I will want to send them, I will want to give them a question that asks, Have you been, have you already figured out how to achieve this task much more efficiently using AI and potentially other technology solutions, question mark, using AI or other technology solutions, question mark. But it won't just be about AI. That's important as well. That's important to consider too. So, even, even if they have figured out, I will, I want to ask them, I will instead want to ask them whether they have already performed metastrategic brainstorming for this task. And if not, it will send them to metastrategic brainstorming. If yes, it will ask, would you like to spend up to five minutes? Would you like to spend another five minutes thinking about how to achieve this even more efficiently? And then it will give a yes and a no. On the yes, it will send them to metastrategic brainstorming. And on the no, it will send them somewhere else. And the functionality that I will eventually want is the user will be asked to reflect on which strategies they used actually worked well. The user will be prompted to perform a metastrategic reflection. The reflection step will have more questions. And perhaps in the planning, it will prompt them to make a prediction. I'm not going to add all of the features. I think just choosing the most important task, setting clear goals. If and only if it's unclear what goals make sense for this task, perform backchaining. We will want a feature for planning projects, but we'll do this later. We'll add that later. For now, just planning tasks or work sessions is good enough. Yes, it will ask, what is the most important thing you could do with this work session? Then the user will say something and it will trust the user. But perhaps just to make sure, it will say, just to make sure, according to your task management system, is this actually the most important thing you could be doing? And when it asks them what the most important thing is, it will provide an option that says view tasks, where it will move them to their AI management matrix, where they have provided, where they have categorized their tasks according to their importance and their ability to delegate it to AI. And additionally, the AI management matrix, as I outlined in the post, it will ask them to, before entering anything in the matrix, they will have an option to list all of their tasks. They can do this in whatever system they're using at the moment. If they already have a task list, they can just use that and try to identify among all of those, the top 20% of tasks and only enter those in the AI management matrix. Because prioritizing the tasks in the matrix takes cognitive work and time. So you want to pre-prioritize and chuck out the low-impact tasks such that you have less work to do, prioritizing such that you don't have to run all of them through the AI management matrix. Though if that doesn't go well, the AI management matrix is still considering the task's importance. I said, um, I noticed that and I will practice coherent, eloquent articulation. The AI management matrix will still consider the task's importance in case the user is bad at prioritizing, in case they add way too many tasks, they will prioritize even further using the matrix by assigning their most important tasks into those categories and only doing those in a given day. And perhaps it will simply have a few lists. After all, I'm building the product that I would like to see in the world. So perhaps it will just have something like processed ideas. It will have unprocessed ideas or tasks. Then from there, the user will be able to process them or have AI process them even better. However, the user will be able to process them, but they will have an opportunity to request AI assistance in the processing, upon which the, our AI that we built, that we fine-tuned, trained, and prompt engineered based on our needs will provide them with a prioritization that is based on our existing prompt engineering. And then they will be able to get feedback on the prioritization and chat with the AI, telling it to prioritize them differently. And once done, they will have an option to move the tasks into categories individually. And they will have an option to assign an urgent tag to the tasks. Or it will just say urgent behind the task description or something like that. Maybe it will be a color. That is not what matters right now. The point is that we will use AI to auto-prioritize the tasks or at least offer auto-prioritization of the tasks. after which they will have the option to move it, move the tasks automatically move the tasks into either into the backlog for the bottom 80% or the AI management matrix for the top 20%. Well, in the in the AI management in the top 20% of tasks we will have another kind of unprocessed list or this will be our active task list. Right. This these will be our active tasks and the bottom 80% will be our backlog. And in our active tasks we will be able to rate the tasks we will have four lists basically which we might display in matrix form or just I think more effectively would just be four lists that on the screen are arrayed in matrix form and then the user can sort the tasks into those categories by dragging and dropping them and at any point the user will have each of those categories the user will have the ability to move them between the lists and with that ability with that system in place when the user is asked to when the user is asked about the most important task they could be working on it will it will give them the option it will display a field that says view AI management matrix or it will have a button a field that they can click that says view task management system or view task manager no not task manager view task management system or perhaps view process tasks where processing is filtering them into the AI management matrix it will let them view process tasks and if if they try that and the process tasks are empty it will give them a view view unprocessed active tasks instead if that is also empty it will give them a view view ideas list or something like that it will it will offer them two options which are view backlog and view unprocessed ideas or just ideas really because ideas by default are unprocessed and if they are processed then they are tasks so there will be four components of this of the management system but I already broke them down so I don't have to recap here then again it was tasks maybe I will want to get google calendar integration though it doesn't matter much they can just put the task in their calendar themselves this is one of those marginal efficiency gains features that's not essential so it's not what we'll be adding right now essentialism is about less but better we will have less features but make the ones we do truly shine and deliver them to our highest possible standard yet I think with the app we'll have two components that are truly essential which is the planning phase where the user sets goals where the user chooses a task for this work session sets goals for this work session and does metastrategic brainstorming or they will get a prompt for metastrategic brainstorming it will ask them whether they've done it already or not or it will just deliver them that's a hassle it will just deliver them to the metastrategic brainstorming and give them a skip button and then it will ask them to make a prediction because calibrating your intuitive judgment is a key to acquiring expertise but here they will again get a skip button so if they don't think it's valuable they can just skip it but it will say something like the research has shown us that calibrating your intuitive judgment is a key estimate or forecast something like that make a prediction for example about how long a particular subtask will take or how well a particular thing will go just something like that by default they'll be making a prediction about how long a subtask will take for this I'll and it will say that to use this feature you to use this feature you will need to sign up to Facebook where you will be able to track your calibration which is our partner and the sign up takes less than the sign up takes about two minutes because they can just sign in with their Google account and then once they've made a prediction it will offer them to make another prediction or proceed to the task but they will also have the option to skip it and once they're done it will give them the option to once they proceed to it it will offer them a kind of feel that says now go on and do great things press this button once you're done to start your reflection something like that where they will get the ability the opportunity to start the reflection at any time and the reflection that it will have essential components it will ask them whether they achieved their goals it will show them their goals and for each one they'll get to tick it if they achieved it then they will get to remove completed tasks from process tasks and then they will be asked to reflect um I said um that was unnecessary I noticed that and I will practice coherent eloquent articulation then they will get a metastrategic reflection where it will ask them about the strategies they used which ones actually worked and so on and so forth which ones were useful and where else they expect them to apply and this information we want to feed it to our AI system as training data on which strategies work for which tasks and based on that it will offer it will adjust the suggestions it offers in the future and how we implement that well we can just have an AI scoring system that does something like for each of the strategies that were suggested we can simply use a chat bot that will go with for each of the strategies that were suggested well I don't have to figure out the nitty gritty details right now but basically I think that basically here was unnecessary I will add that to the list I was saying that the user will be asked to reflect on their work session and they will for that reflection to update or or something like that which tasks which parts were unnecessary how could they have done better oh and here again based on i will have several i will want several floodgates or something like that not really floodgates several logical gates that give the user different prompts based on their experience where they will get to now i want to keep this short and lean i don't want to add excessive time to their work block that's essential i will just let them pick for now which type of reflection is appropriate here and for the ai suggestions they will be able to give feedback and for the strategies that they come up with they will be able to list them separately and then for each strategy they listed they will be able to to select it for use say these ones are the one i actually want to use and they will be they will have an opportunity to give feedback on the ai suggestions just numerical i guess star rating or something like that give one to five stars for the ai suggestions and those will be training data as well allowing us to generate better ai suggestions for how to achieve tasks more efficiently and based on the the outcomes for example if their prediction went wrong if their prediction went wrong if their prediction went wrong they will be able to say what actually happened right they'll want to check how their prediction went if they made one if they made one it will ask them it will ask them to resolve it and if it was wrong it will ask them to explain what happened and they will then have a an opportunity to a button that prompts them to compare to ai explanation but yes they will i think what is important something that is important is asking them what were the main obstacles that were holding them back from making more progress especially if they did not achieve their goals if they did achieve their goals it will perhaps ask them how they could do even better next time they will be they will be answering if they completed metastrategic brainstorming then for each of the strategies they they selected they will be able to say whether they actually use them and for each of the strategies that they actually use they will be able to give it a rating from one to five stars and then this rating will be saved into their individual in their person into their personalized cognitive strategy toolbox and then they will also get to enter a custom strategy a custom strategy that they can also assign a one to five star rating to and the high start the highly rated strategies the the ai that suggests the strategies for the user will have access to that user's cognitive strategy toolbox and it will have a prompt to suggest highly rated strategies if they seem appropriate for this situation and explain that it did so because it was highly rated oh and yeah the reader will uh the user will get an an optional prompt to think or extrapolate where else would these strategies for any strategies that worked particularly well where ask where else would this apply if yeah if and only if they rated they rated a strategy at four or five stars they will receive a prompt that says you rated this this strategy seemed very useful where else would it apply where else do you expect it to apply and then again they'll be able to give a short answer or request ai assistance and they either get to submit their answer once they submit their answer they get to request ai assistance and they will they will have the option of thinking about it and providing a note for and making a note for themselves that will be added this will be added as information for the cognitive strategy toolbox which which in which strategies will be sorted by their style rating and they will have information on which task they were used for and where else they the user expects them to apply and then here again they can receive ai suggestions and based on the ai suggestions they will have an opportunity to something something they will have an opportunity to write to provide feedback on the they will be asked to provide feedback on the ai suggestions this will be mandatory but they can just give a one to five star rating not thinking much about it but if they really want to in the corner of the screen or something like that they will have a skip button and the ai suggestions they will eventually be based on the strategies that other users found useful so based on gathering the data based on gathering the performance data from all of the users and what strategies they found useful i will be able to train our ai to give extremely useful suggestions and then they will be able to they will be able to they will get another prompt that again they can skip all of this it will ask them to once they start reflecting it will say good job for completing the session and give them a nice congratulation animation and at the end of the reflection and at the end of the reflection it will give them a great job for reflecting on your performance reflecting reflection is the foundation of skill acquisition you're one step closer to mastering one step closer to mastery so at this point as i said the user uh yeah before the end they will be able to suggest they will be able to write down takeaways what they what they would have done differently in hindsight what they would like to do better next time expect what they would have liked to do differently in hindsight or or how they could do better next time and for this maybe this will be the only mandatory thing well picking a task would also be mandatory and they will be asked to suggest just one or two improvements just one or two ways in which they could have done this more efficiently and here again if they submitted here again they can request ai suggestions what they would have done differently in hindsight or how they could have made progress more efficiently and specifically maybe it will give them the prompt for what patterns should they pick should they have picked up on because this is the because that is particularly manifold particularly powerful for calibrating one's intuitive judgment that's about pattern recognition but regardless maybe that won't be in the in the most important one maybe that'll be a separate one what matters is yeah what would you have is there something you would have done differently in hindsight a cue or pattern you you should have picked up on a cue or pattern that would have been useful to pick up on that would have been useful to pick up and yeah the prompt will will ask them to identify identify just one or two ways they can they can do better next time next time they work on a similar task and then it will store yeah they will they will get to do that and then once they're done with the session once they complete it they will be able to store once the session is completed the session will be stored in their session in their work session log where they can look at all of the amazing work sessions they completed and it will be it will be stored with with all of the data about what they were trying to achieve with strategies they use and what they think what they end up what are they what they ended up thinking they would like to do differently in the future this all of this data will be stored in their in their in their session history or maybe i will give it a more glorifying name like they are they are session hall of fame or they are that trophy something something and each time whenever they complete a certain amount of sessions they will get a milestone like they will get a milestone for completing their first session and taking their taking a step towards mastery or radical effectiveness in fact every time they complete a session it will ask them to every time they complete a session they will be asked no it will tell them how many sessions they completed congratulations you completed your 21st deliberate performance session if they didn't achieve their goals it will they will be asked whether they would like to reflect on what went wrong in detail and if they achieved their goals they will be asked whether they would like to explain what went well in detail no actually just rating their strategies already does the work of explaining what went well but if they didn't achieve their goals then they'll receive the prompt to reflect on the obstacles and regardless in the in the most important prompt they get which is the one where they get to suggest just one improvement they will be asked or in in in step with that in tandem with that or in that prompt they will be asked whether there is whether there were any parts of the process that were unnecessary whether in hindsight they could have delegated one of one of those parts to ai is there a part was there a part of the process that in hindsight could have been delegated to ai and they will they will get to write an answer here and if if that makes sense i would like to here again let them request ai assistance to which can suggest improvements things that they could do better next time especially this will be more more calibrated i think if they provided data on the obstacles they encountered yeah that's that then it will show them the work session completed screen that i just mentioned to make it more rewarding and such and they will then get a prompt to reflect on their marginal gains or celebrate marginal gains or maybe they will get that before the before the end screen yeah okay no that makes sense to do to do before when it asks them whether they achieve their goals they will get to log marginal gains for this session marginal gains that they that they completed that they achieved in this session and maybe in the goals section where it asks them to set to set goals maybe that will actually ask them to define a marginal gain that serves as their goal and then if they reached it then that will then that will then they will get to celebrate that and if they didn't reach it then they will they will get to to they will receive encouragement for trying and at the end it will it will encourage them it will tell them that mistakes are stepping stones mistakes are stepping stones to success or learning from mistakes as the fun it will ask it will say don't worry learning from mistakes is the foundation of improvement there we go i think i now gave a rough overview of all the essential features and some less essential ones that we'll want to nevertheless integrate at some point like the ai management matrix the task management system that is that is powerful and aligned with what we're trying to achieve but we don't need it for the for the start for the start all we want is to have the the prompts and have the responses recorded in their in their account that's the most essential thing to build and then the next essential thing is to add ai assistance at the ai at the ai assistance feature and then improve that feature set up a feedback loop to improve the suggestions over time and once these two things are in place we can start we can start getting user feedback i noticed i started here and again i will practice coherent eloquent articulation we can start gathering user feedback once we even have just the reflection prompts and no ai systems that's when we can start gathering the feedback and maybe the ai assistance will be a premium feature or something like that or they will get to use this for free for a whole month and then after a month uh i noticed i said ah here i noticed that and i will practice coherent eloquent articulation they will get to they will require a membership to keep using it or really really i want i want to make this i said i want twice i noticed that and i will practice coherent eloquent articulation i want to help as many users as possible i want every high impact professional to be able to use this to upskill and prepare for the tai era but then again i have my posts that i already give away for free so this app will have some free features just the basic functionality will be free the minimum bible product version will be free and that's what we'll give to all of our users as well just the reflection prompts will be free but then if they want ai assistance that will be a premium feature and maybe they'll get to test it for free for a week and then if they want to keep using it they'll need to subscribe to premium no i will the ai suggestions will be free for a longer time maybe as much as a month such that we get a lot of users for the ai suggestions so that we can improve them based on their feedback so maybe it'll start out free and later it will become a paid feature or maybe it will maybe they will get a one month free trial including the ai suggestions or maybe the feature will have a beta period where it's experimental and then once it's fully released we will make it a premium feature however they will get a one week free trial and during the beta phase and the one week free trial everyone will get to test the ai suggestions and see for themselves that they're useful and worth paying for so there we go there we have a brilliant concept so what matters now is to build it quickly so we can be the first on the market to deliver this and get a head start of anyone else who might be coming up with the same idea though i do think it's hard to replicate without without a bunch of testing which i have personally done so it's not easy to replicate but we do still want to get it out as soon as possible just in principle i mean just i noticed that the i mean was unnecessary i will practice coherent eloquent articulation just out of principle just from a principles perspective we want to get it out as soon as possible and with this clear plan that i outlined now i will have to organize it but it will be once i organized it once i set up voice transcription i will be able to have this all written out get the get an ai to organize it and then that vision we can just feed it into replit i can give it to joy and i can feed it to replit and then she can figure it out from there and boom we have an app and we won't be launching it yet this is obviously still in the testing phase and i want to use this app to apply to startup incubators and such based on just the minimum viable feature and the minimum viable product i meant to say i noticed that i noticed the i mean and i will practice coherent articulate coherent eloquent articulation i meant to say the minimum viable product once we got that built we can use it for testing we can use it for research that demonstrates its effectiveness and if i come up with a good way or find in the literature a good way of measuring productivity then the users will have and will have the ability to the users will have the ability to use that app to track their productivity and see their productivity increase over time and i will also want a feature that allows them to at the end of the session give feedback or rate the experience with the app did you feel like this meaningfully your opinion matters to us or even your experience is our primary con is our prime concern did the app meaningfully facilitate your learning and efficiency you you you you you you you you And then they will provide a one to five star rating or I'll even just run a survey or after using the session once, yes, after testing our app, this amount of users said that it meaningfully facilitated their learning. And this is what this is what I'll want them to this. This is what I want the data for. I want the data so that I can use it as credibility. And if they liked it, they can, they will, well, occasionally be asked to give us a good review if they haven't already on Google Play Store. Like once the app that like was unnecessary, I noticed that and I will practice coherent, eloquent articulation. Once the app is launched, they will occasionally receive requests to give us positive reviews if they like the app. We could even ask them to tell their co-workers, tell their friends or co-workers about it. This won't be very frequent, but oh, they will have a session. They will have a feature. There will be a feature that lets them share your progress, share their progress with their friends or co-workers. Once the session is over, at the end of each session, they will get a share feature, which of course is fully optional, where they will get to where they will there will be some kind of prompt saying that sharing your progress can be motivating and keep your team, keep you fuel, keep you energized, or something like that. Sharing your accomplishments can be motivating, just something along those lines. I will say that, that is to say there will be a prompt saying that as a kind of caption for the share button, which will of course be optional, after it's said great job for completing your 21st or whatever number it is, session. That's a deliberate performance session. That's another, another step towards radical effectiveness, which this is inspired, of course, by the Atoms app. And there we go.
